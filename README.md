# Scripts
# 'run_Analysis.R': R script which does the following:
# 1. Read the source data files & merge the training and test sets to create one dataset with descriptive variable names
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
# 3. Use the descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
# 4. Create a new dataset with the mean for each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Code Book
# 'CodeBook.md': Describes the steps taken in the script to create the output file. 

# Output Data Files
# 'cleandata.csv': New dataset with the mean for each variable for each activity and each subject
